But I have not yet been silenced by the darkness
Nor by the gloom that has covered my face. ( <a href="https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/nwt/books/job/23/#v180230175">Ancient Writings</a> )

I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
Oh a million dreams for the world we're gonna make
