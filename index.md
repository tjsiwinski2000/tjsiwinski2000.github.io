But I have not yet been silenced by the darkness
Nor by the gloom that has covered my face. (<a href="https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/nwt/books/job/23/#v180230175">Ancient Writings Job23:17</a>)

You cannot scale a mountain in a single step; however, you can take on the challenge one step at a time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/102014125">magazine article</a>)


I think of what the world could be <br>
A vision of the one I see <br>
A million dreams is all it's gonna take <br>
Oh a million dreams for the world we're gonna make <br>


With our eyes of faith, <br>
We see beyond the clouds <br>
And know that the storm soon will cease <br>
